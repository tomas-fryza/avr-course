# Generate documentation from source code

[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) is a free, multiplatform (Linux, Windows, Mac, ...) tool for easy generation of program manuals. It supports popular programming languages such as C++, C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, Fortran. Doxygen also supports the hardware description language VHDL. It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in LaTeX) from a set of documented source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the source code.
