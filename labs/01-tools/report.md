# Lab 1: INSERT_YOUR_FIRSTNAME INSERT_YOUR_LASTNAME

### Morse code

1. Listing of C code which repeatedly sends the character `A` or the string `PARIS` in Morse code on LEDs. Let the "dot" be displayed on one LED and the "dash" on the other. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow C guidelines:

```c
int main(void)
{
    // Set pins where LEDs are connected as output
    pinMode(LED_GREEN, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(LED_RED, OUTPUT);

    // Infinite loop
    while (1)
    {
        // Generate Morse code here

        // WRITE YOUR CODE HERE

    }

    // Will never reach this
    return 0;
}
```

2. Draw a schematic of Morse code application, i.e. connection of AVR device, two LEDs (one in active-high, second in active-low way), two resistors, and supply voltage. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all components and their values!
