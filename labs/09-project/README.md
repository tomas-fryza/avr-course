# C project

### Topics

*Topics will be presented one week before the project starts.*

**Smart plant watering system and data logger**
*Max 3 groups.*
Propose and develop an intelligent plant watering system using soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, a relay, and a Microcontroller Unit (MCU). The project should aim to automate the plant watering process based on soil moisture conditions, provide visual feedback, record and export data logs, and, optionally, incorporate a notification feature for relevant updates.

**Configurable multi-channel PWM generator**
*Max 3 groups.*
Develop a versatile PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) generator system using AVR microcontrollers and C programming. The project aims to create a multi-channel PWM generator that can produce variable frequency and duty cycle PWM signals on multiple output channels. The PWM generator should be highly configurable and user-friendly. See https://www.vokolo.cz/generator-pwm/

**Measuring electricity**
*Max 2 groups.*
Create a versatile and user-friendly system for measuring various electrical parameters, including voltage, capacitance, resistance, current, and more. The primary focus is on applications such as solar panel and battery meters.

**Simple arcade game**
*Max 2 groups.*
Create an engaging and interactive arcade-style video game using an AVR microcontroller as the core processing unit. The game will be played using buttons, analog joysticks, and displayed on an OLED screen. Optionally, the project can incorporate an I2C MPU9060 gyro and accelerometer for an enhanced gaming experience.

**GPS-based environmental sensor data logger**
*Max 2 groups.*
Create a comprehensive data logging system using an AVR microcontroller. The system integrates GPS functionality for location tracking and an I2C environment sensor to capture data related to environmental conditions. The project aims to log and display sensor data and provide the capability to export the collected information for analysis.

**Electronically controlled xylophone**
*Max 1 group.*
Build an electronic xylophone instrument that can be played using an AVR microcontroller. The project will combine hardware and software components to create an interactive and programmable musical instrument capable of producing different tones and melodies. Incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the notes being played.

## Instructions

The objective of this group project is to collaborate within small teams (3-4 students), explore a chosen topic, use [labs's components](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/digital-electronics-2/blob/master/README.md#components), develop innovative solutions, simulate and execute these solutions, generate project documentation, and present the final outcomes. Team members are responsible for organizing and assigning roles and tasks among themselves.

* Students will work on a project **in the labs** during the 9th to 13th weeks of the semester, with the practical demonstration scheduled for the last week.

* Using BUT e-learning, students should submit a link to the GitHub repository containing the C project, required images, documents, and a descriptive README file. **The submission deadline is the day before the demonstration.**

* The AVR code must be written in C and/or Assembly and must be implementable on an Arduino Uno board using the toolchains provided during the semester, specifically PlatformIO. The use of Arduino frameworks/libraries or any other development tools is not permitted!

* Create own library for each component.

* Physical implementation on AVR is required, not just computer simulation.

* Make a short video of your app demo. (The video can then be used to promote the course.)

## Help:

* Create a block diagram and ciruit diagram (schematic) of your application.

* Optionally design a PCB layout and/or 3D box.

* Draw illustrative flowcharts for all important functions/interrupt routines.

* Strictly follow licenses for third-party libraries !
