# C project

## Instructions

*The goal of this project is for small teams of 3-4 students to explore a chosen topic, use the [labs's components](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/avr-course/blob/master/README.md#components), develop solutions, simulate and implement them, create documentation, and present the results. Team members will organize and divide tasks among themselves.*

* The students will work on the project for five weeks, ending with a presentation and a practical demonstration (simulations alone are not enough).

* The AVR code must be written in C and/or Assembly and must be implementable on an Arduino Uno board using the toolchains provided by PlatformIO (exceptions by agreement).

* The use of Arduino frameworks/libraries is strictly prohibited!

* Use simulation tools, such as [SimulIDE](https://simulide.com/p/), [Falstad](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html), etc.

* Draw illustrative flowcharts for all important functions/interrupt routines.

* Design a block diagram or circuit diagram of your application (EasyEDA, KiCAD, Eagle, ...).

* Optionally, design a PCB and/or 3D-printable enclosure for your solution.

* Use libraries from the labs. Create own libraries (and documentation) for the new components.

* Follow coding standards in your codes.

* Strictly follow licenses for third-party libraries !

* Create a public [GitHub](https://github.com/) (or other online software development platform) repository for your project and publish all files here.

* Provide a list of all tools used during the project, including Machine Learning (some are listed [here](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/avr-course/wiki)).

* A PowerPoint-style presentation is not required; a good README on GitHub is sufficient.

* During the presentation, you can play a short video (max 1 minute) with subtitles or explanatory captions.

### Topics 2024/25

**Measurement/Control/Visualization of the environment for tropical plants**
The goal of the project would be to create a system that measures key environmental parameters (such as temperature, humidity, light levels, soil moisture) for tropical plants. This system should also allow the user to control or adjust environmental conditions and visualize the data.

Inspiration: [Climate Chamber System](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/ms_peach/climate-chamber-system-c545de)

**Concept of an autonomous vehicle**
*Max 2 team per group.*
The aim of the project would be to design and build an autonomous vehicle capable of performing line following, obstacle detection, and possibly other basic navigation tasks.

Inspiration: [NCP Cup 2025](https://nxpcup.nxp.com/)

**Solar panel monitoring and optimization**
*Max 2 teams per group.*
The goal of this project is to design and implement an embedded system that leverages solar panels for power generation while monitoring solar radiation, energy output, and efficiency. The system will collect real-time data using sensors to analyze the performance of solar panels and provide insights for optimizing energy production.

Inspiration: [Simple Arduino Solar Radiation Meter for Solar Panels](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/mircemk/simple-arduino-solar-radiation-meter-for-solar-panels-ae1531), [Photovoltaic battery charger with sun tracking](https://www.vut.cz/en/students/final-thesis/detail/151699)

**Electronically controlled xylophone**
*Max 1 team per group.*
Build an electronic xylophone instrument that can be played using an AVR microcontroller. The project will combine hardware and software components to create an interactive and programmable musical instrument capable of producing different tones and melodies. Incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the notes being played.

**Usage of CubeSat Space Protocol (CSP)**
*Topic provided by [YSpace](https://www.vut.cz/en/yspace) group.*
Test of multiprocessor communication.

**Another topic related to, for example, your bachelor's thesis.**
(Must be arranged in advance.)
