# C project

### Topics 2023/24

*New topics will be presented one week before the project starts.*

**Smart plant watering system and data logger**
*Max 3 groups.*
Propose and develop an intelligent plant watering system using soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, a relay, and a Microcontroller Unit (MCU). The project should aim to automate the plant watering process based on soil moisture conditions, provide visual feedback, record and export data logs, and, optionally, incorporate a notification feature for relevant updates.

**Configurable multi-channel PWM generator**
*Max 3 groups.*
Develop a versatile PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) generator system using AVR microcontrollers and C programming. The project aims to create a multi-channel PWM generator that can produce variable frequency and duty cycle PWM signals on multiple output channels. The PWM generator should be highly configurable and user-friendly. See https://www.vokolo.cz/generator-pwm/

**Measuring electricity**
*Max 2 groups.*
Create a versatile and user-friendly system for measuring various electrical parameters, including voltage, capacitance, resistance, current, and more. The primary focus is on applications such as solar panel and battery meters.

**Simple arcade game**
*Max 2 groups.*
Create an engaging and interactive arcade-style video game using an AVR microcontroller as the core processing unit. The game will be played using buttons, analog joysticks, and displayed on an OLED screen. Optionally, the project can incorporate an I2C MPU9060 gyro and accelerometer for an enhanced gaming experience.

**GPS-based environmental sensor data logger**
*Max 2 groups.*
Create a comprehensive data logging system using an AVR microcontroller. The system integrates GPS functionality for location tracking and an I2C environment sensor to capture data related to environmental conditions. The project aims to log and display sensor data and provide the capability to export the collected information for analysis.

**Electronically controlled xylophone**
*Max 1 group.*
Build an electronic xylophone instrument that can be played using an AVR microcontroller. The project will combine hardware and software components to create an interactive and programmable musical instrument capable of producing different tones and melodies. Incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the notes being played.

**Another topis related to, for example, your bachelor's thesis.**

## Instructions

*The goal of this project is for small teams of 3-4 students to explore a chosen topic, use the [labs's components](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/avr-course/blob/master/README.md#components), develop solutions, simulate and implement them, create documentation, and present the results. Team members will organize and divide tasks among themselves.*

* The students will work on the project for five weeks, ending with a presentation and a practical demonstration (simulations alone are not enough).

* The AVR code must be written in C and/or Assembly and must be implementable on an Arduino Uno board using the toolchains provided by PlatformIO (exceptions by agreement).

* The use of Arduino frameworks/libraries is strictly prohibited!

* Design a block diagram or circuit diagram of your application (KiCAD, Eagle, ...).

* Create own library (and documentation) for the new components.

* Use simulation tools, such as [SimulIDE](https://simulide.com/p/), [Falstad](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html), etc.

* Draw illustrative flowcharts for all important functions/interrupt routines.

* Optionally, design a PCB and/or 3D-printable enclosure for your solution.

* Create a public GitHub repository for your project and publish all files here.

* Provide a list of all (online) tools used during the project, including Machine Learning.

* Strictly follow licenses for third-party libraries !

* A PowerPoint presentation is not required; a good README on GitHub is sufficient.

* In the presentation, you can show a short video (max 1 minute) with subtitles or explanatory captions.
